<br><b><u>Subject</u>: &nbsp; &nbsp; Plane crashes into NY skyscraper<br>
<br><u>Date</u>: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tue, 11 Sep 2001 09:27:06 PST</b><br>
<br>
<br>About 10 minutes ago, a small plane crashed into the North side of one of the World Trade Towers (once the world's tallest <a href="http://www.skyscraper.org">skyscraper</a>.)<br>
<br>
<br>The  weather is clear, with blue skies. At this time, nobody knows how many were hurt or killed. It is 9 AM New York time. The building is still burning. An explosion was just heard by me here in <a href="http://www.bayridge.com">Bay Ridge</a>, many miles away near the Narrows bridge!<br>
<br>
<br>The local TV stations just went off the air. Nothing but static now! The TV antennae are on the top of the World Trade Center.<br>
<br>
<br>The last time this happened was during World War II when a plane crashed into <a href="http://www.esbnyc.com">The Empire State Building</a> in dense weather.<br>

<br>All <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/fdny">firehouses</a> are to contribute men/equipment to the blaze. Saint Vincent's hospital is the main receiving site for victims. There are 50 to 100 persons that arrived in &quot;critical&quot; condition.<br>
<br>
<br>As of now, 10 AM, the WTC is still burning. It is reported that people are jumping from the burning building.<br>
<br>
<a name="rescue"></a>
<br>The top part of the building has just collapsed down onto the Plaza below.<br>
<br>-------<br>
<br>
<br>I've tried to call &quot;Fireman Bill&quot; &amp; &quot;Nurse Sue&quot;, but their line is busy. As far as I know, Sue is home on maternity leave. I don't know if Bill is at work, but assume he will be, if not. Bill was one of the very first fire-fighters on the scene at the first bombing of theWorld Trade Center some years ago.<br>

<br><b><u>Subject</u>: &nbsp; &nbsp; Palestinians, &amp; attacks on USA.<br>
<br><u>Date</u>: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tue, 11 Sep 2001 14:51:57 PST</b><br>
<br>
<br>Bay Ridge, Brooklyn NY<br>
<br>
<br>The largest attack ever on USA's mainland was cheered by arab groups celebrating on the West Bank of Israel. Afghanistan, however, claims that they and Osada Bin Laden have nothing to do with the attacks.<br>
<br>
<br>Some reports say that up to 50,000 people may be dead, wounded, or sick. About 40,000 people work at the World Trade Center every day. This is about the same as the population of the 
Greater <a href="http://www.aalesund.kommune.no">Aalesund</a> city area. Nearly 250,000 people visit the WTC area daily.<br>
<br>
<br>There are also some claims that a cloud of &quot;germ-warfare&quot; biological agents may also have been released. Lower Manhattan has been closed off. Hospitals are running out of [O-] blood. Gas lines are still leaking gas. Fires are still burning. The 170 city hospitals are filling up. Some patients are ferried out to Liberty Island.<br>
<br>
<a name="cynic"></a>
<br>As a former &quot;Saigon Bomb-Rescue Squad&quot; member during the Viet-Nam war, I took a walk over to the local City Council office in Bay Ridge to see if I could do anything. (They took my name &amp; telephone number.) Election Day is coming up, and I think that the local politicians might be trying to make this event fit their re-election hopes.... but, maybe I'm just a cynic!<br>
<br>
<br>Here in Bay Ridge the streets are part of the world's biggest parking lot. New York's traffic was totally stopped! Nobody was allowed across the nearby Verrazano bridge without being searched and identified first. Trucks were the last priority, including a truckload of unfortunate
live chickens, suffering in the hot sun. Every corner became a traffic jam, but about 1PM traffic finally started flowing.<br>
<br>
<br>I was amazed how fast <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/pdny">Police</a>, Military, and Special Agents were all over the place, almost on every corner, at the federal <a href="http://www.usps.com/locator">Post Office</a> building, the <a href="http://www.hamilton.army.mil">Fort Hamilton</a> civilian housing center, etc... I thought I'd check my e-mail at the local library, but all <a href="http://www.brooklynpubliclibrary.org">Brooklyn libraries</a> were ordered closed. The <a href="http://www.mta.info">subway</a> station was blocked off too.<br>
<br>
<br>Bay Ridge police were a bit in disarray as radios &amp; cell-phones weren't working correctly. Motorists were over-loading the rest of the cell-phone network too. Apparently, like the TV stations, the tall WTC towers had vital communication links there. The old-fashioned copper wire
telephone lines work just fine.<br>
<br>
<br><a href="http://www.nysed.gov/nyc">Schools</a> were supposed to keep the kids inside until their parents came for them, but many kids were out wandering in the streets. I asked one of them about that. She said, &quot;No, they told us to go home.&quot; So, apparently there is confusion there too.<br>
<br>
<br>Well, I guess I'll take a trip down to the shore to look across the bay to see what is left of Lower Manhattan.<br>
<br>
<br>Take care,...<br>

<br><b><u>Subject</u>: &nbsp; &nbsp; A WTC walk around Bay Ridge<br>
<br><u>Date</u>: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tue, 11 Sep 2001 22:22:52 PST</b><br>
<br>
<br>Before I could take my walk down to the shore to view Lower Manhattan, I started getting telephone calls: E_____ at work... A___, R__, S__... I told them B__ in Paris had just sent me an e-mail. He'd been trying to get through to them, but their line was busy. &quot;Fireman Bill&quot; was on the
Brooklyn side of the river at that time, around 6 PM. Hopefully, he'll stay there! We have no idea yet where his brothers went. They too are New York City firemen. Anywhere from 50 to 100 firemen and police are now &quot;missing&quot;... considered dead.<br>
<br>
<br>Some schools did keep their kids inside until the parents came for them after work. About 100 kids are still waiting. It's believed their parents may have worked in the WTC area.<br>
<br>
<br>When I came outside, the street scene had changed:<br>
<br>The traffic jam was all gone! No traffic at all. Mostly empty streets.<br>
<br>The regular Police Force had been changed out with volunteer Auxiliary Police. One of these was even clad in sandals &amp; shorts, wearing a bright orange POLICE traffic jacket. Walking past the 86th Street subway, I saw that it was back in business again.<br>
<br>
<br>The sky was bright blue with a slight breeze making for great tee-shirt weather today. But, above Bay Ridge was a strange very long gray cloud. This cloud stretched suspiciously thinner and darker towards the direction of Manhattan. I walked down 86th Street towards the shore.<br>
<br>
<br>Almost every store and business on 86th was shuttered tight since noon (except McDonalds), ...even the 24-hour drugstore that NEVER closes! Some of these, like &quot;<a href="http://www.c21stores.com">Century 21</a>&quot;, are owned by American Jews, others by new Russian or Korean immigrants. The banks are probably closed all over the USA for security.<br>
<br>
<br>When I got to the shore I saw Lower Manhattan burning.<br>
<br>
<br>Along the shore were hundreds of amateur photographers snapping the scene of a smoking Manhattan WITHOUT the Twin Towers, and thousands of others were just looking on.<br>
<br>
<br>Suddenly, the steady smoke plume changed form. A huge belch of smoke erupted. I went over to a cluster of folk listening to a radio. &quot;The World Trade Center's building number 7 has just collapsed.&quot; (Building No.7 was &quot;only&quot; 42 stories tall.) A siren made us look over to the Leif Ericson Drive highway alongside the shore. Driving past us from Manhattan was a truck loaded with burned soot-covered cars. The radio continued: &quot;All of Manhattan below Chinatown is to be evacuated.&quot;... &quot;It is still unknown what the white powder that was spread around is, not until &quot;Hazardous Material&quot; (HazMat) testing is totally completed.&quot; ... &quot;We don't know the amount of casualties.&quot; ... &quot;Barbara Olsen, the wife of a government official, was a hi-jacked passenger that called in information about the terrorists on her cell-phone.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>I walked further to the 69th Street Pier, but that was blocked off to the public. It was reserved for a possible ferry &amp;/or helicopter area.<br>
<br>
<br>Walking away from the shore, along 69th Street, I passed the Arab Men's Tea House. Usually its doors &amp; windows were wide opened to the sidewalks. Today they were shut. Two policemen stood across the street.<br>
<br>
<br>Mayor Guiliani warned that no citizen should take &quot;justice&quot; into their own hands. The mosque on Fifth Avenue had a Police patrol car watching there. I assume that the old &quot;<a href="http://www.sonsofnorway.com">Sons of Norway</a> Hall&quot; on Eighth Avenue, which is now Bay Ridge's main mosque, has similar police guards. Along the now Arab (once Scandinavian - Irish - English) Fifth Avenue there are stationed police officers at regular intervals. NONE of the many Arab stores here were closed. ALL were open! Here and there an Irish bar, like &quot;Killarny's,&quot; was also open... sometimes with a huge American flag
spread out over their awning in open defiance of their non-alcohol imbibing Moslem neighbors!<br>
<br>
<br>By the time I got home it was getting dark. World Trade Center building number 5 is still burning.<br>
<br>
<br>Take care all!<br>
<br>*********<br>
<br>
<br>P.S. - You can see my route by looking up any Internet map.<br>
<br>P.P.S. - Maybe I'll go take a &quot;skaal&quot; at &quot;Killarny's&quot;....<br>

<br><u>Date</u>: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wed, 12 Sep 2001 09:31:59 PST</b><br>
<br>
<br>One of &quot;Fireman Bill's&quot; cousins died when the Towers collapsed. Both of his brothers are OK as of now. But Bill lied when he told his wife, &quot;Nurse Sue&quot; that he was in Brooklyn yesterday. He was at The World Trade Center fires.<br>
<br>
<br>The Pentagon in Washington is still burning.<br>
<br>
<br>I woke today to a very quiet New York City. Every morning I usually wake up to the noise of 2 or 3 TV helicopters hovering over my house, competing with each other to report the early rush-hour traffic conditions on the next-door Verrazano Narrows Bridge. Today, no air traffic is allowed to fly anywhere in U.S. airspace between Canada and Mexico except the occasional military jet, or police helicopter. I woke up to birds singing today instead of TV helicopters.<br>
<br>
<br>The emergency area in Manhattan is expanded.<br>
<br>
<br>Now anybody driving South of 14th Street without &quot;official purpose&quot; will be arrested.  This area is the third largest business district in the USA, and the whole World's financial hub. International bank &amp; finance records are strewn all over, blowing in the wind. The whole area is considered an official crime investigation scene. All bridges &amp; tunnels between Manhattan &amp; New Jersey are closed. The Staten Island ferry to Manhattan too. Highways along Manhattan's shores are closed, except for &quot;official business.&quot; Dead bodies are being stored in the Manhattan Coroner's Office. Only 45 have been identified so far. Other areas for bodies will be in The Bronx, West Side pier-storage buildings, and an aircraft carrier arriving in New York Harbor soon.<br>
<br>
<br>Since I'm in the New York construction business, I've been asked: &quot;How could the Towers fall?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>When I worked for <a href="http://www.turner.com">Turner</a> Construction at <a href="http://www.thegarden.com">Madison Square Garden</a> and Penn Station, our subcontractor's superintendent in charge of the steel structure was Vito Anzalone (Bethlehem Steel). Later, Vito was in charge of the World Trade Center's steelwork, and still later I took a Construction Management brush-up course at <a href="http://www.scps.nyu.edu/rei/">NYU</a> with Vito. Since New York's commercial construction people are a very small and close group, me &amp; Vito exchanged &quot;war stories&quot; about the local construction business and about our own projects.<br>
<br>
<br>One thing I learned was that the Towers are not like most &quot;normal&quot; skyscrapers. They are built like hollow tubes to increase the open floor space. Each floor is an acre of space without columns. All the floors, more than a million tons, are supported by those shiny fire-proofed aluminum &amp; stainless-steel clad outside-columns you see in the tourist photos. There were more than 12 different types of steel used to make sure that the loaded columns would compress evenly, insuring level floors &amp; plumb elevators. The interior support was at the elevator-shaft core. 60-foot beams radiated from the core out to the exterior columns. Below-ground, under the Towers, are the subway lines, railroad, shops, and parking for 2,000 cars.<br>
<br>
<br>The hijacked airliners were fully loaded with jet fuel. After they crashed, an intense blaze must have overwhelmed the sprinkler system, making a virtual &quot;oven&quot; of that floor. Once the temperature of that floor raised the temperature of the steel columns to the point of collapse, the whole Tower just caved in upon itself, sliding down the elevator core.<br>
<br>
<br>Interestingly, my father (he would have been 100 years old later this month) worked on the Empire State Building when the TV antennae was installed. That's New York's ONLY working TV antennae now. All the competing stations are off the air, or using cable-TV. The Norwegian
carpenter's union (<a href="http://www.nycdistrictcouncil.com">Local Union #787</a>) here in Bay Ridge set up the safety scaffolding  for the steel-workers that built the antennae on top of the building.<br>

<br>
<br>Now, after over 30 years, The Empire State Building has again become New York's tallest building. (Maybe the era of tall buildings is over?)<br>
<br>
<br>Take care,...<br>

<br><u>Date</u>: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wed, 12 Sep 2001 19:59:20 PST</b><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>About a half-hour ago, the last few floors of one of the Tower buildings just crumbled even further. New gas leaks are reported. There are pockets of fire here and there in the rubble. The army of rescue workers are understandably cautious... and tired.<br>
<br>
<br>&quot;Fireman Bill&quot; is on duty again today... 24-hour duty! He came home last night for a few hours, to sleep and to check on his family. &quot;Nurse Sue&quot; is due to deliver her baby at any time now... any minute! Her doctor is stranded in Las Vegas. Her hospital (Saint Vincent's) is the main WTC crisis center. A___ &amp; R__ are waiting with her &amp; the kids.<br>
<br>
<br>The Pentagon fire has just been put out. The building abandoned.<br>
<br>
<br>Rumors fly that fire-fighters from forest fires Out West will be coming to relieve the New York Fire department.<br>
<br>
<br>---------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>War?<br>
<br>
<br>According to the TV media's &quot;talking-head&quot; commentators... we are now &quot;at war.&quot; Congress is trying to formulate a formal &quot;declaration.&quot; But against who? That's the problem. The President says &quot;There WILL be punishment.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>Apparently an Egyptian is a prime suspect. But, it's very doubtful Egypt could be considered &quot;the enemy.&quot; Afghanistan? They say they're not to blame either..... Maybe the terrorists are hiding, headquartered in some unlikely country, ...like Norway? Sweden?<br>
<br>
<br>The lesser local politicians are now crawling onto my TV screen, making patriotic speeches in support of other politicians that a few days ago they were sneering at. They seem to be elbowing each other out of the way in order to get as much of their own face onto my TV screen as
possible. Election day is coming soon. Next month!<br>
<br>
<br>Well, I think you can find out as much as I can about this crisis just by checking the internet. A local New York outlet here is TV channel 7 = <a href="http://www.7online.com">http://www.7online.com</a> ... Another site is the FBI's site: <a href="http://www.fbi.gov">http://www.fbi.gov</a>
 and, if you have any information to give the FBI: <a href="http://www.ifccfbi.gov">http://www.ifccfbi.gov</a>
	There are local New York &quot;Yahoo!&quot; and other portals you can check too.... maybe even <a href="http://www.bayridge.com">http://www.bayridge.com</a>
<br>
<br>
<br>Bay Ridge is returning to &quot;normal&quot;.... Lower Manhattan will not be normal again for a long time.<br>
<br>
<br>=====================<br>
<br>Some of you have asked for my  permission to send my writings further to their friends, family, etc....  Sure. that's OK with me, but I PLEASE only ask one thing: FIRST remove all the other e-mail addresses before you send out or &quot;forward&quot; copies. I'd like to protect their privacy, OK? (You can leave your own address, if you want.)<br>
<br>=====================<br>
<br>
<br>My thought was that my impromptu &quot;electronic newsletter&quot; from New York City to our spread-out family members and friends might help a bit at this time of crisis. I hope it did.<br>
<br>
<br>One thing I learned in Viet-Nam: There is almost NO way to stop a determined suicide bomber.<br>
<br>
<br>On Valder&oslash;y, in a wooden memento box I made as a teenager at school, is a tiny fragment of steel. Unless I showed it to you, you would not know what it was. It is what's left of a Vietnamese mini-taxi's engine block... That, and the license plate were the largest pieces of the taxi we could identify again after the &quot;Victoria Billets&quot; bombing in Saigon. The taxi was a suicide bomb. When was that? Somewhere in my stacks of papers on Valderoey is an old yellowed 1965 or 1966 Vietnamese newspaper. The Viet-Cong &quot;Kamikazes&quot; tried to bomb our billets, but fortunately for us our guards were alert, and with a hail of bullets forced them to move off down the street, instead blowing up the unlucky Victoria and the Buddhist monastery next door.<br>
<br>
<br>No, suicide bombers have one-way tickets!<br>
<br>
<br>Mayor Guiliani was worried about possible lootings, lynchings, etc. here in New York. But, as far as I've heard, things are very calm here, at least in Bay Ridge.<br>
<br>
<br>I wrote basically from my hearing the local TV news here... and from the explosions I heard, and from walking around the neighborhood and observing,... and, of course, my own quite biased opinions. Yes, as usual, I put my own little &quot;spin&quot; on things!<br>
<br>
<br>What is the real truth? We'll never ever know. Everybody has their own point of view.... But, sooner or later everybody will decide on what the &quot;official&quot; truth should be. Then it will go into the history books as gospel! (Unless the other side wins later on, of course.)<br>
<br>
<br>Maybe one good thing might be that America will finally wake up to the fact that the Pacific &amp; Atlantic oceans no longer protect them. The &quot;Free Trade Zone&quot; also leaves the Mexican &amp; Canadian borders wide open too. The USA is no longer in control of its own country.<br>
<br>
<br>The primary responsibility of any government is to protect its people and its borders. Otherwise, they're just &quot;play-acting&quot;....<br>
<br>
<br>I only hope we don't lose even more of our own individual freedoms because of this. If so, then &quot;the other side&quot; has actually won the game.<br>
<br>
<br>Take care,<br>
